# Download .vsix
Simple browser extension adding a page action to download .vsix files from the Visual Studio Marketplace. The `activeTab` permission is required to parse the URL, for generating a correct download link.

Now with support for downloading older versions!

If this stops working for any reason, please make an issue! I won't use this too often myself, and others will certainly find errors before I do.
